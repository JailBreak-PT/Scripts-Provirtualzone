# Linux VMware to Hyper-V Migration Scripts

A comprehensive suite of PowerShell and Bash scripts to automate and standardize the migration of Linux virtual machines from VMware to Hyper-V. This toolchain is designed to be robust, idempotent, and compatible with a wide range of new and legacy Linux distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Oracle Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, etc.).

- **Automated Workflow:** Uses PowerShell to remotely prepare and execute migration tasks.
- **Multi-Distro Support:** Contains specific logic to handle RPM/DEB packages, systemd/SysVinit services, and GRUB Legacy/GRUB2 bootloaders.
- **Safe by Design:** Includes pre-migration backups, post-migration validation, and a clear rollback procedure.
- **Idempotent:** Scripts can be run multiple times without causing harm, intelligently skipping steps that are already complete.
- **Offline Capable:** Designed to work without internet access on the target VMs, using locally staged driver packages or ISOs.

## Why Use This Toolchain?

Migrating a Linux VM between hypervisors can be a complex process. This toolchain automates the most critical and error-prone steps:

- **Network Configuration:** Automatically backs up the original static IP settings and restores them after the migration, preventing loss of connectivity.
- **Driver Management:** Ensures the correct Hyper-V drivers are present in the boot configuration, preventing a "no boot" scenario.
- **System Cleanup:** Properly removes old VMware Tools to avoid driver conflicts and system instability.
- **Bootloader Handling:** Safely creates a temporary boot entry for the first boot on Hyper-V and provides a mechanism to make it permanent after a successful validation.

## The Scripts

This repository contains a full workflow of coordinated scripts.

| Script Name                                  | Purpose                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1_Linux_SSH_Bootstrap.ps1`                  | **(PowerShell)** Establishes initial key-based SSH trust with a Linux VM. Runs once per VM.                |
| `2_Linux_Run_Copy.ps1`                       | **(PowerShell)** Copies all necessary Bash scripts to the target VM and executes the pre-migration process. |
| `Linux_Pre_Migracao_AllDistros.sh`           | **(Bash)** The main preparation script. Backs up the network, removes VMware Tools, and prepares GRUB.      |
| `Linux_Post_Migration.sh`                    | **(Bash)** The first script to run after booting on Hyper-V. Restores the network and makes the boot permanent. |
| `Post_Migration_Validation.sh`               | **(Bash)** A comprehensive validation tool that checks system health and offers to finalize the migration.    |
| `Linux_rollback_validacao_migration.sh`      | **(Bash)** A utility to revert a VM to its original VMware state if the migration fails.                |

## How to Use (The Migration Workflow)

The process is divided into pre-migration, migration, and post-migration phases.

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration (on VMware)

This phase prepares the Linux VM for the move.

1.  **Install SSH Key:**
    -   Edit `1_Linux_SSH_Bootstrap.ps1` to set the target `$IP`.
    -   Run the script. You will be prompted for the `root` password once.
        ```powershell
        .\1_Linux_SSH_Bootstrap.ps1
        ```

2.  **Execute Pre-Migration:**
    -   Edit `2_Linux_Run_Copy.ps1` to set the target `$IP`.
    -   Run the script. It will copy all files and run the main preparation script on the remote VM.
        ```powershell
        .\2_Linux_Run_Copy.ps1
        ```
    -   Once this script completes successfully, shut down the VM in VMware.

### Phase 2: Migration

- At this point, the VM is fully prepared. Use your preferred tool (SCVMM, Veeam, etc.) to migrate the VM's virtual disks from the VMware datastore to your Hyper-V host and create a new VM using them.

### Phase 3: Post-Migration (on Hyper-V)

1.  **First Boot (Critical Step):**
    -   Power on the VM in Hyper-V and open the console.
    -   At the GRUB boot menu, you **must manually select** the entry named **`Hyper-V (pré-migração)...`**. This ensures the VM boots with the necessary drivers.

2.  **Restore Network & Finalize Boot:**
    -   After the VM boots, connect to it via SSH.
    -   Run the post-migration script. This will restore the original static IP address and make the Hyper-V boot entry the permanent default.
        ```bash
        cd /root/migracao_files
        bash ./Linux_Post_Migration.sh
        ```

3.  **Validate and Clean Up:**
    -   Run the final validation script to ensure everything is working correctly.
        ```bash
        bash ./Post_Migration_Validation.sh
        ```
    -   If all critical checks pass, the script will ask if you want to remove the temporary "pré-migração" GRUB entry. Press `s` to confirm and complete the process.
